This is a simple tool for investigating the number of occurence each instrument in any given subset of all songs.


To use it, simply run 'python webapp.py' from this directory, and then go to 'localhost:5000' or '127.0.0.1:5000' in your browser. In the form that appears, choose the grouping you want to use, and the songs you want to include (choose multiple songs by holding 'ctrl' or 'cmd'), and then click 'Check' to see the results.
